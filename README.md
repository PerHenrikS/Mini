## Mini - A super minimalistic static site generator

Mini is not a site generator for the masses. For my own small blogging site a CMS seemed like overkill. To learn a static site generator that has to be configured did not feel like fun, so I decided to write my own. 

### Planned features

- [ ] Template inheritance for more complicated layouts
- [ ] Media files 
- [x] Cli for ez usage
- [ ] Easier template themes
- [x] Command: init - initialize directory 

### Stuff to think about

- [x] Post author config (join post with generator) ?
- [ ] Clean code - make it more idiomatic
- [ ] Nicer error handling
